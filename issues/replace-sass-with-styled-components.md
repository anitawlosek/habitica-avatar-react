### Proposal
Replace the current SASS-based styling with Styled Components for better modularity and scalability. Styled Components integrate seamlessly with React, allowing for scoped styles and dynamic theming.

### Benefits
- Scoped styles to avoid conflicts.
- Easier to maintain and scale.
- Enhanced developer experience with modern CSS-in-JS.

### Steps to Implement
1. Install Styled Components:
   ```bash
   npm install styled-components
   ```
2. Replace existing SASS files with Styled Components.
3. Update documentation and examples.

This change will align the project with modern React styling practices.
