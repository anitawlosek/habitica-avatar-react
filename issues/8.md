## Updated Description for Issue #8

### Adding Unit Tests with Vitest

To improve our testing strategy, we will be adding unit tests using the Vitest framework. Below are the steps and details necessary for this implementation:

#### 1. Setting Up Vitest
- **Install Vitest**: First, add Vitest to your project by running the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev vitest
  ```
- **Configure Vitest**: Create a `vitest.config.js` file in the root of your project with the following content:
  ```javascript
  import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
  
  export default defineConfig({
    test: {
      globals: true,
      environment: 'jsdom',
    },
  });
  ```

#### 2. Writing Tests
- **Create Test Files**: For each component and utility, create a corresponding test file. For example, if you have a component called `MyComponent.vue`, create a file named `MyComponent.test.js` in the same directory.
- **Example Test**: Here is a simple test example for a component:
  ```javascript
  import { render } from '@testing-library/vue';
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue';
  
  test('renders correctly', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(MyComponent);
    expect(getByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```

#### 3. Ensuring Test Coverage
- **Enable Coverage Reporting**: You can enable coverage reporting by adding the following option in your `vitest.config.js`:
  ```javascript
  export default defineConfig({
    test: {
      coverage: {
        reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      },
    },
  });
  ```
- **Run Tests with Coverage**: Execute the tests with coverage reporting by running:
  ```bash
  npx vitest run --coverage
  ```

Following these steps will ensure that we have a solid foundation for testing our components and utilities, as well as proper coverage reporting. Let's aim to increase our code quality and reliability through these unit tests!
