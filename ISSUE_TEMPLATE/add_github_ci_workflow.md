### Add GitHub CI workflow for build status badges

Add a GitHub CI workflow to automate project tasks such as builds, tests, and code linting. Once the workflow is set up, include status badges in the README file to indicate the status of these workflows. The badges should display green when workflows succeed.

#### The workflow should:
- Run on all pushes and pull requests.
- Include steps for building the project, running tests, and linting.
- Generate badges that can be embedded in the README file.

This will help improve visibility into the health of the codebase and provide quick feedback to contributors.
